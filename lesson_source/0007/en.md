Python Logic
===================

Checking conditions
-------------------

Comparisons: true or false?
---------------------------

Let us now talk about comparisons. Let's look at how they behave in a
short math lesson:

	>>>  2 > 1 True >>> 1 == 2 False >>> 1 ==
	>>>  1.0 True >>> 10 >= 10 True >>> 13 <= 1 + 3
	>>>  False >>> -1 != 0 True

The result of a comparison is always `True` or `False`. Comparisons can
be combined into more complex conditions by using the words and and or:

	>>>  x = 5 >>> x < 10 True >>> 2*x >
	>>>  x True >>> (x < 10) and (2*x > x) True >>> (x
	>>>  != 5) and (x != 4) False >>> (x != 5) and (x != 4) or (x ==
	>>>  5) True

Python Love - exercise
----------------------

Now lest talk about love with our wonderful snake. Write this in your
interpreter.

	>>>  import this >>> love = this >>> love is
	>>>  this >>> love is not True or False >>> love is love

In python we can compere using few different operators:

-   ==
-   is
-   !=
-   not
-   >=
-   <=
-   in

and connect the expressions with:

-   and
-   or

Is same as == ?
---------------

Lest make few test if 'is' is the same as '==':

```python
>>> 1000 is 10**3 >>> 1000 == 10**3
>
>>> "a" is "a" >>> "aa" is "a" * 2 >>> x =
> "a" >>> "aa" is x * 2 >>> "aa" == x * 2
>
>>> [1, 2] == [1, 2]
>>> [1, 2] is [1, 2]

>>> [1, 2] is [1, 2]

```

Conclusion: is will return True if two variables point to the same
object, == if the objects referred to by the variables are equal.

BMI: Fat or not ? let the python decide for You
-----------------------------------------------

Let’s go to our next problem. We want our program to print the
appropriate classification for the calculated BMI by using the table
below:

  BMI            Classification
  -------------- ----------------
  < 18,5      underweight
  18,5 – 24,99   normal weight
  25,0 – 29,99   overweight
  ≥ 30,0         obesity

We need to use the “conditional statement” if. It will execute the rest
of the program depending on a given condition:

Exercise simple python calculator
---------------------------------

Write a simple calculator script that will take two numbers and
calculation sign (+, -, *, /). And output a nice string show whole
calculation and the solution. Remember: string + string = new string :-)
Example:

	>>>  'Enter first number' 10 >>> 'Enter first number
	>>>  math sign (+, -, *, /)' + >>> 'Enter second number' 5 '10 +
	>>>  5 = 15'

Indentations
------------

Another thing you should pay attention to is the indentation in the
code. Open the interactive mode and enter a simple condition such as:

>>> if 2 > 1:
...

So far nothing has happened, as evidenced by dots `...` instead of a
prompt `>>>`, which we have seen so far. Python expects us to give
further instructions that are supposed to be executed if the condition
`2 > 1` turns out to be true. Let’s try to make Python print "OK":

```python
>>> if 2 > 1:
... print("OK")
  File "<stdin>", line 2
    print("OK")
        ^
IndentationError: expected an indented block

IndentationError: expected an indented block

```

Unfortunately, we did not succeed. Python needs to know whether the
instruction we have written is a continuation of if or it is the next
instruction not covered by the condition. To this purpose, we need to
indent our code:

	>>>  if 2 > 1: ... print("OK") ... OK

All you need is one space or `TAB`. However, all the lines that are
supposed to be executed one after another should be indented the same
way:

```python
>>> if -1 < 0:
...  print("A")
...   print("B")
  File "<stdin>", line 3
    print("B")
    ^
IndentationError: unexpected indent

>>> if -1 < 0:
...     print("A")
...   print("B")
  File "<stdin>", line 3
    print("B")
            ^
IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level

>>> if -1 < 0:
...   print("A")
...   print("B")
...
A
B

B

```

To avoid chaos, most Python programmers use four spaces for each level
of indentation. We will do the same:

	>>>  if 2 > 1: ... if 3 > 2: ... print("OK") ... else:
	>>>  ... print("FAIL") ... print("DONE") OK DONE

What if not?
------------

Actually, we could write our program just by using if :

```python
if bmi < 18.5:
    print("underweight")
if bmi >= 18.5:
    if bmi < 25.0:
        print("normal weight")
if bmi >= 25.0:
    print("overweight")

    print("overweight")

```

We can also use else and elif to avoid repeating similar conditions and
increase readability. In more complex programs it may not be obvious
from the beginning that a certain condition is the opposite of the
previous one.

Using else , we have the guarantee that the given instructions will be
executed only if the instructions printed under if haven’t been
executed:

```python
if bmi < 18.5:
    print("underweight")
else:
    # If your program executes this instruction,
    # for sure bmi >= 18.5 !
    if bmi < 25.0:
        print("normal weight")
    else:
        # now for sure bmi >= 25.0, we don’t have to
        # check it
        print("overweight")

        print("overweight")

```

Pay particular attention to the indentations. Every use of else, will
cause an increased indentation of our code. It is very annoying when you
have to check a few or a dozen or so conditions which exclude one
another . Therefore the authors of Python added a little 'improvement'
in the form of elif, instruction, which allows you to check another
condition immediately:

```python
if n < 1:
    print("one")
elif n < 2:
    # if it wasn’t n < 1, and now it is n < 2
    print("two")
elif n < 3:
    # ,if none of the previous condition was true.
    # n >= 1 i n>= 2, ale n < 3
    print("three")
else:
    # trolls can count only to three
    print("more")

    print("more")

```

Exercised data:
===============

| BMI          | WOMEN         |
|--------------|---------------|
| < 17,5       | underweight   |
| 17,5 – 22,49 | normal weight |
| 22,5 – 27,49 | overweight    |
| ≥ 27,5       | obesity    |

| BMI          | MEN           |
|--------------|---------------|
| < 19.99      | underweight   |
| 20 – 24,99   | normal weight |
| 25,0 – 29,99 | overweight    |
| ≥ 30,0       | obesity       |

Summary
=======

We now know some basic python logic, and we can use it.
